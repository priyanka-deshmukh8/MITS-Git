# Security Policy

To report a vulnerability, please follow the steps outlined below:

1. **Reporting process:** To report a vulnerability, please send an email to our security team at [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com). Provide as much detail as possible about the vulnerability, including a description, steps to reproduce, and any supporting materials such as proof-of-concept code or screenshots.

2. **Response time:** Our security team will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide an initial assessment of the vulnerability. We strive to keep you informed throughout the process.

3. **Investigation and verification:** Our team will conduct a thorough investigation to assess the reported vulnerability. We may reach out to you for additional information or clarification during this process.

4. **Patch development:** If the vulnerability is accepted, our team will prioritize the development of a security patch or an appropriate fix.

5. **Release and notification:** Once a patch or fix is ready, we will release it in the form of a security update. We will notify you of the release and acknowledge your contribution, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

6. **Security update schedule:** We aim to release security updates on a regular basis, depending on the severity of the vulnerabilities and the complexity of the fixes. Our goal is to provide timely updates to ensure the security of our software.

7. **Vulnerability status:** If a reported vulnerability is determined to be outside the scope of our project or not a genuine issue, we will inform you of the reason for the decision. However, we value all vulnerability reports and appreciate your contribution to our project's security.

Please note that while we strive to address vulnerabilities in a timely manner, the response and resolution times may vary depending on the nature and severity of the reported issue.

Thank you for helping us ensure the security of our project.
